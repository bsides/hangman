HangmanJS
=========

Just a Hangman game made out of Javascript. The code was based on the hangman game made from Codecademy. I refactored it into something more readable, according to a lot of good javascript practices around. I also played with Grunt, Node and other stuff here, just to practice some frontending skills.

### Install
You know the drill. I already built this so it's a no-brainer - just run app/index.html anywhere. If you prefer, ```grunt serve``` will do nicely too.
