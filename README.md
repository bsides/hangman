HangmanJS
=========

Just a Hangman game made out of Javascript. The code was based on the hangman game made from Codecademy. I refactored it into something more readable, according to a lot of good javascript practices around. I also played with Grunt, Node and other stuff here, just to practice some frontending skills.

### Install
You know the drill. No? Okay. Here it goes:
```
git clone git@github.com:bsides/hangman.git
cd hangman
npm install
grunt serve
```
You can also make it production ready with ```grunt build```, of course.

Have fun! :smile_cat:
